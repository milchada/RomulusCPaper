This is the code for my 2019 paper. Fountains and storms: The role of AGN and mergers in disrupting the cool-core in the RomulusC simulation. Key functionalities include:

- comparing AGN activity to specific star formation, core entropy, and mass of cold infalling gas in the core.
- phase maps of the entropy as a function of radius
- maps of the cluster in various properties at various snapshots and zoom levels
- making profiles of density, temperature, entropy, pressure, cooling time and colour-coding by epoch
- computing free fall time and circular velocity as a function of radius
- (not used in final paper)
